# d3_final_proj

Currently working: Node creation, force simulation, draggability

Currently using toy data to perfect the visualization

Issues to discuss at Tuesday D3 office hours:

* Best way to structure / import dataset (having some difficulty with json)
* Why links, despite being coded for, do not appear
* Enabling the tooltip code (currently commented out) throws the entire graph out of whack - why?
* Functions for assigning colors / link strength based on data
