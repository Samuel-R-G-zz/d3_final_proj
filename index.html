 <h1 align="left" style = "font-size:35px;">Mapping Common<br>Political Interests<br>Among Top Donors</h1>
			<div id = "text">
				In the 2017 - 2018 election cycle, the top 100 individual campaign donors accounted for nearly 700 million dollars
				in donations, or nearly 15% of the total amount of money raised for the election. These donors are universally extremely
				wealthy and influential individuals.
				This network graph attempts to map specific political "factions" or interest groups among these donors
				on the basis of their shared campaign contributions.
				<br><br>
				Each node in the graph represents a single donor, and links between the nodes represent
				donations to one or more of the same recipients.
				Bigger nodes and thicker links correspond to larger contributions.
				<br><br>
				Click on a node for more detailed information about a given donor, and to
				highlight its neighbors. Click on empty space to reset the highlighting. Nodes can also be dragged for additional clarity.
